# sbubbot

This is a bot that, when summoned on a thread, uses a convolutional neural network to try to identify which subreddit(s) the image fits in best with.

## Currently analyzed subs

I tried to choose a good mix of subreddits with different styles. This will probably change.

* EarthPorn
* awwnime
* cats
* VaporwaveArt
* AdviceAnimals
* RoomPorn
* AbandonedPorn
* vexillology
* astrophotography
* dankmemes
* ATBGE
* fakealbumcovers
* lossedits
* me_irl
* ladyboners
* gentlemanboners

## Wtf it's not working with my image!

Sorry! It's hard to support a bunch of different sites. Sites that should work include:

* Most imgur links
* i.redd.it (reddit's own image hosting service)
* Any link that directly points to an image file

Unsupported sites include:

* imgur album links
* gif or video links
* Any site that disables hotlinking

Text posts are also not supported, as are any imgur or i.reddi.it posts that have been deleted.

## This bot sucks and I want it off my sub

Sure! If you're a mod of a sub, ping me at /u/notverycreative1 and I'll add your sub to the blacklist.
